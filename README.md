# Wiki CLI?

Search Wikipedia and read summaries directly in your terminal!

## Usage

```
# The first step is obvious...
npm i -g wiki-cli

# Then, just call `wiki` alone to enter the interactive mode...
wiki

# ... or, directly with keywords you'd like to search for...
wiki Jesus nut

# You can read the not so helpful help page with option `-h` or `--help`...
wiki -h

# ... or, specify the locale with `-l` or `--lang`
wiki -l de Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz
```

## Why

Cuz Ink is awesome, React is fun, and JavaScript is everywhere. Also it's a demo app for my CLI talk. And, who doesn't love Wikipedia?

## Todo

See TODO tags in the source code.

Also need to write some more docs.
