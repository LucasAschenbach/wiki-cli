# Wiki CLI?

Search Wikipedia and read summaries directly in your terminal!

## Usage

```
# The first step is obvious...
npm i -g wiki-cli

# Then, just call `wiki` alone to enter the interactive mode...
wiki

# You can read the not so helpful help page with option `-h` or `--help`...
wiki -h
```

## Why

I love CLI, and Ink is awesome! ;)
